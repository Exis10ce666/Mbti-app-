# PersonaView image drop zone

All mockups, portraits, and illustrations are user-supplied—the repo does **not** bundle any copyrighted imagery. Export the visuals from your design tool (e.g., Figma/Sketch/PSD) and drop them here using the exact filenames referenced in the widgets (such as `intp.png`, `enfj.png`, `welcome.png`).

The Flutter widgets already include fallbacks, so if a file is missing you will see a gradient placeholder instead of a crash. Once your images are in place, Flutter will hot-reload them from this folder.
